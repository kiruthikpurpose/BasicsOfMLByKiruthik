# Machine Learning Models Repository

This repository contains implementations of various machine learning algorithms. The models range from basic classifiers and regressors to more advanced algorithms like CNN for image classification. These scripts are designed for educational purposes, allowing users to understand how different machine learning models work and how to implement them in Python using libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, and TensorFlow.

## Algorithms

### 1. Linear Regression
   **File:** `linear_regression.py`  
   A regression model that predicts continuous values using the linear relationship between independent and dependent variables.

### 2. Logistic Regression
   **File:** `logistic_regression.py`  
   A classification algorithm for binary classification problems, predicting discrete labels (0 or 1).

### 3. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
   **File:** `knn_classification.py`  
   A simple, instance-based learning algorithm used for both classification and regression.

### 4. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
   **File:** `svm_classifier.py`  
   A powerful classification model for linearly separable and non-linearly separable data using kernel trick.

### 5. Decision Tree Classifier
   **File:** `decision_tree.py`  
   A tree-based model used for classification tasks by splitting data into subsets based on the feature value.

### 6. Random Forest Classifier
   **File:** `random_forest_classifier.py`  
   An ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees and merges them to get a more accurate and stable prediction.

### 7. Naive Bayes Classifier
   **File:** `naive_bayes_classifier.py`  
   A probabilistic classifier based on applying Bayes' theorem with strong independence assumptions between features.

### 8. K-Means Clustering
   **File:** `kmeans_clustering.py`  
   An unsupervised algorithm that partitions the data into k clusters by minimizing intra-cluster variance.

### 9. PCA (Principal Component Analysis)
   **File:** `pca_dimensionality_reduction.py`  
   A technique for reducing the dimensionality of the dataset by transforming to a lower-dimensional space.

### 10. CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) for Image Classification
   **File:** `cnn_image_classification.py`  
   A deep learning algorithm specifically designed for processing structured grid data like images.
